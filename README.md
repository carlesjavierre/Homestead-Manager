# Homestead-Manager

Make sure you change the path to your Homestead folder. By default, it's on ```"%userprofile%\Homestead\"``` (which resolves to ```"C:\Users\{user}\Homestead\"```)

No instructions. Pretty self explanatory.

You have four options.
1. Restart VM
2. Suspend/Resume VM 
3. Suspend VM and close
4. Destroy VM and Restart it
5. Destroy VM and close
6. Get Status
7. Update
8. Close

If you get stuck and a simple VM restart doesn't solve your problem, try the option 4 "Destroy VM and Restart it" so it configures everything again.

You should also try updating it from time to time (option 7).
