# Homestead-Manager

Make sure you change the path to your Homestead folder. By default, it's on ```"%userprofile%\Homestead\"``` (which resolves to ```"C:\Users\User\Homestead\"```)

No instructions. Pretty self explanatory.

You have four options.
1. Restart VM
2. Destroy VM and Restart it
3. Destroy VM and close
4. Close

If you get stuck and a simple VM restart doesn't solve your problem, try the option 2 "Destroy VM and Restart it" so it configures everything again.
